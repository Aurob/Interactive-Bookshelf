# Interactive Bookshelf

This is an interactive bookshelf in HTML5, it's simply a picture of my bookshelf rendered in a canvas.
Each book has a clickable polygon around the spine that opens a preview of the book cover and provides a link to it on [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/) or [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com).
