# Interactive Bookshelf

This project is an interactive bookshelf that allows users to view the book collection and get more information about each book. The application displays an image of the bookshelf with clickable book covers. When a user clicks on a book, a modal window opens with a larger book cover image and a link to the book's information on OpenLibrary or Goodreads.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Hover over the books on the bookshelf to see the clickable areas.
3. Click on a book to open a modal window with more information about the book.
4. Click on the book cover image in the modal window to open a link to the book's information on OpenLibrary or Goodreads.
5. Click outside the modal window to close it and return to the bookshelf.
